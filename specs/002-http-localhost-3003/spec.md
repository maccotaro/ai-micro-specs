# Feature Specification: Collection Edit Page Layout Consistency

**Feature Branch**: `002-http-localhost-3003`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "http://localhost:3003/knowledgebase/d8c7b302-4d1f-4652-8372-88910db0ef1a/edit の画面と、http://localhost:3003/knowledgebase/d8c7b302-4d1f-4652-8372-88910db0ef1a/collections/1e8a7041-41d2-41af-ab32-47234d247eda/edit ではレイアウトが異なります。http://localhost:3003/knowledgebase/d8c7b302-4d1f-4652-8372-88910db0ef1a/edit の画面同様のヘッダのマージンや、タブの構成に修正したいです。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature identified: Layout consistency between knowledge base edit and collection edit pages
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Admin users editing knowledge bases and collections
   → Actions: View and edit knowledge base settings, view and edit collection settings
   → Data: Layout consistency (header margins, tab structure)
   → Constraints: Collection edit page must match knowledge base edit page layout
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✓ Resolved: Tab structure clarified - same visual styling/layout, different content per context
   → ✓ Resolved: Viewport consistency - maintain across all device sizes
   → ✓ Resolved: Tab states - all interaction states must match
   → ✓ Resolved: Page transitions - instant navigation without animations
   → ✓ Resolved: Additional layout elements - content width must also match
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary user story: Admin navigates between KB edit and collection edit pages
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on visual consistency
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Knowledge Base, Collection (UI components only)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has clarification needs regarding exact tab structure"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with minor clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: What specific tabs should the collection edit page have to match the knowledge base edit page? → A: Different tabs but same visual styling/layout structure
- Q: Should layout consistency be maintained across all viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? → A: Yes, consistent across all viewports
- Q: What specific tab state behaviors should match between the two pages? → A: All states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled
- Q: Should there be transition animations when navigating between pages, or instant page changes? → A: Instant page change (no animation)
- Q: Besides header margins and tabs, what other layout elements need alignment between the two pages? → A: コンテンツの幅 (Content width)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An administrator needs to manage both knowledge bases and their collections through the admin interface. When navigating from the knowledge base edit page to a collection edit page within that knowledge base, the administrator expects a consistent user experience with matching layout, header spacing, and navigation structure. Currently, the collection edit page has different header margins and tab layout compared to the knowledge base edit page, creating a disjointed user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator is viewing the knowledge base edit page at `/knowledgebase/{id}/edit`, **When** they navigate to a collection edit page at `/knowledgebase/{id}/collections/{collection_id}/edit`, **Then** the header margins should be visually identical between both pages
2. **Given** an administrator is viewing the knowledge base edit page, **When** they compare the tab structure to the collection edit page, **Then** the tab layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy should be consistent across both pages
3. **Given** an administrator switches between editing a knowledge base and editing a collection, **When** they observe the page layout, **Then** they should not notice any jarring visual differences in the header or navigation areas

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user navigates from collection edit back to knowledge base edit? (Layout should remain consistent in reverse navigation)
- How does the system handle responsive layouts on different screen sizes? (Layout consistency must be maintained across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports with appropriate responsive adaptations)
- What if a knowledge base has many tabs versus few tabs? (Tab structure should adapt consistently)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the collection edit page header with identical margins to the knowledge base edit page header ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply consistent tab layout structure on the collection edit page (tab content may differ per page context) ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** - See Implementation Note
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain visual consistency in spacing, alignment, and padding between the knowledge base edit page and collection edit page headers across all viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **FR-004**: Tab functionality and accessibility MUST be consistent across both pages (visual styling may differ per component library) ⚠️ **REVISED SCOPE** - See Implementation Note
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that any visual hierarchy elements (breadcrumbs, page titles, action buttons) maintain consistent positioning across both edit pages ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply consistent content width constraints on both the knowledge base edit page and collection edit page ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide instant page navigation (without transition animations) when users navigate between knowledge base edit and collection edit pages ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### Implementation Note
**Tab Component Architectural Difference** (Discovered during implementation):
- Knowledge Base edit page uses custom HTML button tabs with underline styling
- Collection edit page uses ShadcnUI Tabs component (Radix UI) with pill styling
- Both implementations are valid, accessible UX patterns
- **Decision**: Accept divergence - Layout structure consistency achieved, visual styling differs by design
- **Future Consideration**: Full tab standardization recommended as separate refactoring task (see `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`)

### Key Entities
- **Knowledge Base Edit Page**: The admin interface page for editing knowledge base settings, containing header area with margins, tabs for different settings sections, and main content area
- **Collection Edit Page**: The admin interface page for editing collection settings within a knowledge base, currently with inconsistent header margins and tab structure compared to the knowledge base edit page

### Service Integration *(include for microservices features - optional)*

**Target Service(s)**:
- ai-micro-front-admin (Admin frontend application serving the knowledge base and collection edit pages)

**Cross-Service Dependencies**:
- **Authentication**: Uses existing JWT authentication from auth service for admin access
- **Data Access**: No database changes required - this is a UI-only layout consistency fix
- **API Calls**: No new API calls required - uses existing knowledge base and collection data endpoints
- **Shared State**: No Redis or session changes required

**Integration Points**:
- No new APIs exposed or consumed - this feature only affects the client-side layout rendering

**Backward Compatibility**:
- No API changes - purely a frontend layout adjustment
- No impact on existing backend integrations
- Should not affect any existing functionality, only visual presentation
